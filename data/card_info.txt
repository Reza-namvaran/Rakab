Heroine For each Heroine in your row, add 10 to your strength.\nThe Heroine is not a soldier,\nso its value is not affected by the Bishop, Winter, the Drummer, or Spring, but its added strength is applied last to avoid any confusion
Spring While Spring is in play, check which soldier has the highest value among all player rows.\nAdd 3 to the value of all copies of that card in all player rows.\nNote that the soldier affected by Spring can change during the battle\nOnly winter can chanfe spring
Winter While Winter is in play, the value of each soldier in all player rows is 1.\nOnly spring can change the winter
Scarecrow When you play a Scarecrow, take one of the soldiers from your row back into your hand (if possib0le).\nThe scarecrow cannot be used to take back special cards.
Drummer While you have a Drummer in your row, double the value of each mercenary in your row.\nYou can play additional Drummers, but they have no effect.
Spy For each Spy in your row, add 1 to your strength.\n Also, after each battle, the player with the most Spies takes the battle marker instead of the player who won the battle.\n If players are tied for most Spies, the battle marker is taken as normal.
Turncoat When you play a Turncoat, the battle immediately ends. The rules for who wins,\n who takes the battle marker, etc., are all resolved as normal.

Choose and place it in an empty\nregion on the board; it remains on the board\n(even across multiple battles) until another\nBishop is played. Battles cannot be initiated in\nthe favor markerâ€™s region.
