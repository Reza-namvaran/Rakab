Rakab
This is a 3 - 6 players strategic game based on Condottiere.
In this game, players battle against each other for capturing lands.
If you can captur three adjacent lands, or capture a total of five lands, you'll win the game.

At the begining of the game, the youngest player should start the battle and choose a land for the battle, but after the first match 
the player who won the last land should choose the next land for battle and start that battle.
NOTE: If there was a tie in a match the last player who passed its turn should start the battle.

each player would have 10 cards at the start, the cards won't recharge until all of the players ran out of cards or there is only
one player left that has cards.
NOTE: In the case that there was only one player left with cards all of its cards would burn.

we have 2 types of cards special cards ans soldier cards. soldiers only have a score [from 1 to 6 and 10], and special cards has some abilities
that would affect the game like, decrease each soldier's score in game to 1, or double the score of a player, etc.

The cards are: One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six, Ten [These are soldiers], and Heroine, Winter, Spring, Drummer, Scarecrow [These are special]
NOTE: You can see the description of each card by using help command followd by the card name. e.g. help Winter

In each turn of the battle you can either play a card or pass your turn. The battle goes on until all of the players pass their turns or no one
left with cards.
